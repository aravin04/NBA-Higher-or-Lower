This is a passion project I completed as an NBA fan during my free time during summer of 2023. Players can choose to play the game using stats from the past 10 years in the NBA and play until they accumulate 3 strikes, where they can choose to play again. I used pandas to scrape data from stats.nba.com. Using Python's random module, I developed game logic to create a matchup of 2 random NBA players from the designated season and evaluate which player scored more points per game during that season. The program evaluates the user's answer of higher or lower and awards the user a point for a correct answer and one strike for an incorrect answer. When the user reaches 3 strikes, the game ends and the user is able to see their final score and is asked to play again or exit. Throughout this project I familiarized myself with web scraping and pygame documentation, which allowed me to create this game successfully in pygame. I improved on many areas of programming such as event handling, nested structures, user interface design and game loops. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project as it helped me learn how to effectively troubleshoot and optimize code. To play the game, simply extract the zipped folder and open the nba_higher_or_lower.exe file in the folder.
